## Real life Kit for game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

Serious ReadMe will be added soon.

Now just for short:
 - There is a folder `arduino` with a lot of code to be explained.
 - Arduino is connected to modules, which are made of stripboard,
  two chips and some input/output devices (buttons, LEDs, displays).
 - The folder `fritzing` contains some attemps to show DPS to you. It is not pretty yet.
   Please do not build according to it right away. :-)
