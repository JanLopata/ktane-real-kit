## Real life Kit for game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

Serious ReadMe will be added soon.

Now just for short:
 - There is a folder `arduino` with a lot of code to be explained.
 - Arduino is connected to modules, which are made of stripboard,
  two chips and some input/output devices (buttons, LEDs, displays).
 - The folder `fritzing` contains some attemps to show DPS to you. It is not pretty yet.
   Please do not build according to it right away. :-)
 - In the folder `models` you can add your models (via pull request).

If you have any questions, ask me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ktane/comments/6cxbbc/ktane_real_kit_work_in_progress_wanna_see_more/) or just mail me.
